# Database

* SQL vs NoSQL: High-Level Differences:

| SQL         | NoSQL |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Relational Databases (RDBMS) | non-relational or distributed database   |
|  represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data| the collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores   |
| vertically scalable| horizontally scalable  |
| uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data | queries are focused on collection of documents. also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language)  |
|  MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL| MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb  |
|  good fit for the complex query intensive environment   | are not good fit for complex queries.  |
| are not best fit for hierarchical data storage | fits better for the hierarchical data storage  |
|  emphasizes on ACID properties ( Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) |  follows the Brewers CAP theorem ( Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance )  |

## SQL Database Examples

1. MySQL Community Edition

2. MS-SQL Server Express Edition
3. Oracle Express Edition

### NoSQL Database Examples

1. MongoDB
Mongodb is one of the most popular document based NoSQL database as it stores data in JSON like documents. It is non-relational database with dynamic schema. It has been developed by the founders of DoubleClick, written in C++ and is currently being used by some big companies like The New York Times, Craigslist, MTV Networks. The following are some of MongoDB benefits and strengths:

   * Speed: For simple queries, it gives good performance, as all the related data are in single document which eliminates the join operations.
   * Scalability: It is horizontally scalable i.e. you can reduce the workload by increasing the number of servers in your resource pool instead of relying on a stand alone resource.
   * Manageable: It is easy to use for both  developers and administrators. This also gives the ability to shard database
   * Dynamic Schema: Its gives you the flexibility to evolve your data schema without modifying the existing data

2. CouchDB
3. Redis
