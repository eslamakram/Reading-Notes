## Growth Mindest :+1:
The creativity and positivity way of learning is a growth mindset. In addition to appearing in the growth mindset should turn your negative thoughts to positive.
such as taking criticism as advice and correct their actions and how to learn from it and fix it. In other hands others get it as a failure and effect on them incorrectly

- [x] For me to keep yourself in a growth mindset :
1. View challenges as opportunities
2. Portray criticism as positive
3. love what you want to do
