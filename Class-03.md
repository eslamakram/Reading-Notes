## Lists 
There are three different types of list:
**1. Ordered lists**: are lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number.
` The ordered list is created
with the <ol> element.`
 
**2. Unordered lists**: are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).
` The ordered list is created
with the <ul> element.`
**3.Definition lists**: are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.
