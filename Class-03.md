# Reading notes of class 03
## Lists 
There are three different types of list:
**1. Ordered lists**: are lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number.
` The ordered list is created with the <ol> element.`
 
**2. Unordered lists**: are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).
` The ordered list is created with the <ul> element.`
**3.Definition lists**: are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.
` The definition list is created with the <dl> element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions`
**Notes:**

. Ordered lists use numbers.
. Unordered lists use bullets.
. Definition lists are used to define terminology.
. Lists can be nested inside one another.

## Boxes
we will learn about : 
**size of the box**
Controlling size of boxes : by set your own dimensions for a box you can use the **height and width** properties.

**Box model for borders, margin**

  **padding of the box**
 The padding property allows you to specify how much space should appear between the content of an element and its
border.
The value of this property is most often specified in pixels

 **Displaying and hiding boxes**
