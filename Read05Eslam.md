# JavaScript Operators and Expressions

## JS Operators :


1. Assignment operator : Assign values to JavaScript variables 
 * Example:  	x = y	 
 * In the next table you can see all Assignment Operators that reduce the arithmetic logic by simplifying the logic

2. comparison operator : Compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. 
* Example: Equal (==) 
* In the following table you can see all comparison Operators

3. Arithmetic operators : takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value. The standard arithmetic operators are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
* All arithmetic operators listed in the following table:

4. Logical operators: uses Boolean (logical) values; Also returns a Boolean value. However, the && and || operators actually return the value of one of the specified operands, so if these operators are used with non-Boolean values, they may return a non-Boolean value. The logical operators are described in the following table.

## Loops and iteration

 * Execute a block of code a number of times.

 There are Two different kinds of loops:
 1. FOR Loops : loops through a block of code a number of times
 2. while loops :  loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

 
 * Example of For loop shows the syntax 

```
for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) {
  // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.
  console.log('Walking east one step');
}
```

* Example of while loop that shows the syntax 

```
let n = 0;
let x = 0;
while (n < 3) {
  n++;
  x += n;
}

```
