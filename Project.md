**project 2**
Books Directory
The most basic project you can create using Node.js and Express.js or Nest.js is a simple REST API. 

For this purpose, I’d like to suggest you build a book directory, where you would need to create endpoints, using the four most basic methods: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.

You’d use GET for getting all books or getting only one book by id. With the POST method, you can add a new book to the list. You’d need the PUT method for updating the existing book, and it’s evident that with the DELETE method, you will remove the book from the list. 

For this kind of application, you don’t have to use the database, and for the first app, you can start with data collected as a JSON file.

If you are looking for a ready code of directory app with NodeJS, you can buy it here: [Directory App](https://codecanyon.net/item/app-directory-starter-for-your-directory-app/14131345?irgwc=1&clickid=2%3A5VDX0ZpSg9SpS3FDSITWQNUkBV3CXFk0MRRg0&iradid=275988&irpid=2490362&iradtype=ONLINE_TRACKING_LINK&irmptype=mediapartner&mp_value1=&utm_campaign=af_impact_radius_2490362&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=impact_radius)
**project 3**
 Basic Users System
Another application that you can do for training is a Basic User System. It’s a basic project, but it will help you to practice very useful skills because the user is a part of almost every application. 

In this example, you will learn:  - how to set up the database and do migrations,  - how to create a new user by the registration,  - how to build login endpoint,  - how to authenticate user,  - how to get the user’s data.

In the case of registration and login, you should generate a JWT token for the user that will be returned from the API.

Besides that, remember to hash the password before you save it in the database.

If you’d like to look at how I was doing user registration, login, and authentication in our NodeJS Course.
