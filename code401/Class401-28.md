# Django CRUD and Forms

Django CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) Function Based Views:

+ Create – create or add new entries in a table in the database.
+ Retrieve – read, retrieve, search, or view existing entries as a list(List View) or retrieve a particular entry in    detail (Detail View)
+ Update – update or edit existing entries in a table in the database
+ Delete – delete, deactivate, or remove existing entries in a table in the database

## creating a form

1. create the model :

    ```bash
    # import the standard Django Model
    # from built-in library
    from django.db import models
    
    # declare a new model with a name "GeeksModel"
    class GeeksModel(models.Model):
    
        # fields of the model
        title = models.CharField(max_length = 200)
        description = models.TextField()
    
        # renames the instances of the model
        # with their title name
        def __str__(self):
            return self.title
    ```

    **After creating this model, we need to run two commands in order to create Database for the same.**
        Python manage.py makemigrations
        Python manage.py migrate

2. create form.py

     ```bash
    from django import forms
    from .models import GeeksModel
    
    
    class GeeksForm(forms.ModelForm):
    
        # create meta class
        class Meta:
            # specify model to be used
            model = GeeksModel
    
            # specify fields to be used
            fields = [
                "title",
                "description",
            ]
        ```

3. Create View
Create View refers to a view (logic) to create an instance of a table in the database

    ```bash
        from django.shortcuts import render
        # relative import of forms
        from .models import GeeksModel
        from .forms import GeeksForm
        def create_view(request):
            # dictionary for initial data with
            # field names as keys
            context ={}

            # add the dictionary during initialization
            form = GeeksForm(request.POST or None)
            if form.is_valid():
                form.save()
                
            context['form']= form
            return render(request, "create_view.html", context)
        ```

4. Create a template in templates/create_view.html

    ```bash
        <form method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">

        <!-- Security token -->
        {% csrf_token %}

        <!-- Using the formset -->
        {{ form.as_p }}
        
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
   ```

5. Retrieve View
Retrieve view is basically divided into two types of views Detail View and List View.
**List View**
    List View refers to a view (logic) to list all or particular instances of a table from the database in a particular order. It is used to display multiple types of data on a single page or view

    ```bash
        from django.shortcuts import render
        # relative import of forms
        from .models import GeeksModel


        def list_view(request):
            # dictionary for initial data with
            # field names as keys
            context ={}

            # add the dictionary during initialization
            context["dataset"] = GeeksModel.objects.all()
                
            return render(request, "list_view.html", context)

    ```

6. Create a template in templates/list_view.html

    ```bash
        <div class="main">

            {% for data in dataset %}.

            {{ data.title }}<br/>
            {{ data.description }}<br/>
            <hr/>

            {% endfor %}

        </div>

    ```

7. Detail View
    Detail View refers to a view (logic) to display a particular instance of a table from the database with all the necessary details. It is used to display multiple types of data on a single page or view, for example, profile of a user.
    In geeks/views.py

    ```bash
        from django.urls import path

        # importing views from views..py
        from .views import detail_view

        urlpatterns = [
            path('<id>', detail_view ),
        ]

    ```

8. create a view and template for the same. In geeks/views.py

   ```bash
        from django.shortcuts import render

        # relative import of forms
        from .models import GeeksModel

        # pass id attribute from urls
        def detail_view(request, id):
            # dictionary for initial data with
            # field names as keys
            context ={}

            # add the dictionary during initialization
            context["data"] = GeeksModel.objects.get(id = id)
                
            return render(request, "detail_view.html", context)

   ```

9. Create a template in templates/Detail_view.html

    ```bash
        <div class="main">
            
            <!-- Specify fields to be displayed -->
            {{ data.title }}<br/>
            {{ data.description }}<br/>
        
        </div> 
    ```

10. Update View
    Update View refers to a view (logic) to update a particular instance of a table from the database with some extra details. It is used to update entries in the database for example, updating an article at geeksforgeeks.
    In views.py

    ```bash
            from django.shortcuts import (get_object_or_404,
                                        render,
                                        HttpResponseRedirect)
            
            # relative import of forms
            from .models import GeeksModel
            from .forms import GeeksForm
            
            # after updating it will redirect to detail_View
            def detail_view(request, id):
                # dictionary for initial data with
                # field names as keys
                context ={}
            
                # add the dictionary during initialization
                context["data"] = GeeksModel.objects.get(id = id)
                    
                return render(request, "detail_view.html", context)
            
            # update view for details
            def update_view(request, id):
                # dictionary for initial data with
                # field names as keys
                context ={}
            
                # fetch the object related to passed id
                obj = get_object_or_404(GeeksModel, id = id)
            
                # pass the object as instance in form
                form = GeeksForm(request.POST or None, instance = obj)
            
                # save the data from the form and
                # redirect to detail_view
                if form.is_valid():
                    form.save()
                    return HttpResponseRedirect("/"+id)
            
                # add form dictionary to context
                context["form"] = form
            
                return render(request, "update_view.html", context)
        ```
    Now create following templates in templates folder, 
    In templates/update_view.html
    ```bash
            <div class="main">
                <!-- Create a Form -->
                <form method="POST">
                    <!-- Security token by Django -->
                    {% csrf_token %}
            
                    <!-- form as paragraph -->
                    {{ form.as_p }}
            
                    <input type="submit" value="Update">
                </form>
            </div>
    ```

    In templates/detail_view.html

    ```bash
            <div class="main">
                <!-- Display attributes of instance -->
                {{ data.title }} <br/>
                {{ data.description }}
            </div>
    ```

11. Delete View
Delete View refers to a view (logic) to delete a particular instance of a table from the database. It is used to delete entries in the database for example, deleting an article at geeksforgeeks.
In views.py

```bash
        from django.shortcuts import (get_object_or_404,
                                    render,
                                    HttpResponseRedirect)

        from .models import GeeksModel

        # delete view for details

        def delete_view(request, id):
            # dictionary for initial data with
            # field names as keys
            context ={}

            # fetch the object related to passed id
            obj = get_object_or_404(GeeksModel, id = id)
        
        
            if request.method =="POST":
                # delete object
                obj.delete()
                # after deleting redirect to
                # home page
                return HttpResponseRedirect("/")
        
            return render(request, "delete_view.html", context)

    ```
Now a url mapping to this view with a regular expression of id,
In urls.py

```bash
        from django.urls import path
        
        # importing views from views..py
        from .views import delete_view
        urlpatterns = [
            path('<id>/delete', delete_view ),
        ]
```

Template for delete view includes a simple form confirming whether user wants to delete the instance or not. In templates/delete_view.html,

```bash
        <div class="main">
            <!-- Create a Form -->
            <form method="POST">
                <!-- Security token by Django -->
                {% csrf_token %}
                Are you want to delete this item ?
                <input type="submit" value="Yes" />
                <a href="/">Cancel </a>
            </form>
        </div>
```
