# Dynamic Routes

warmp up questions:
+ How to statically generate pages with dynamic routes using getStaticPaths.

  to create dynamic routes for blog posts:

We want each post to have the path /posts/(id), where (id) is the name of the markdown file under the top-level posts directory.
Since we have ssg-ssr.md and pre-rendering.md, we’d like the paths to be /posts/ssg-ssr and /posts/pre-rendering.
 (Links to an external site.)Implement getStaticPaths
let’s set up the files:

Create a file called [id].js inside the pages/posts directory.
Also, remove first-post.js inside the pages/posts directory — we’ll no longer use this.
The returned list is not just an array of strings — it must be an array of objects. Each object must have the params key and contain an object with the id key (because we’re using [id] in the file name). Otherwise, getStaticPaths will fail.

 (Links to an external site.)Implement getStaticProps
It will return the post data based on id:

```
export function getPostData(id) {
const fullPath = path.join(postsDirectory, `${id}.md`)
const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8')

// Use gray-matter to parse the post metadata section
const matterResult = matter(fileContents)

// Combine the data with the id
return {
    id,
    ...matterResult.data
}
}
```
+ How to write getStaticProps to fetch the data for each blog post.
    Implement getStaticProps
    We need to fetch necessary data to render the post with the given id.
    To do so, open lib/posts.js again and add the following getPostData function at the bottom.
    It will return the post data based on id.
    Then, open pages/posts/[id].js and replace this line.
    The post page is now using the getPostData function in getStaticProps to get the post data and return it as props.
    Now, let's update the Post component to use postData. In pages/posts/[id].js replace the exported Post component with the following code.
+ How to render markdown using remark.
    To render markdown content, we’ll use the remark library.
    First, let’s install it: npm install remark remark-html.
    Then, open lib/posts.js and add the following imports to the top of the file.
    And update the getPostData() function in the same file as follows to use remark.
    Important: We added the async keyword to getPostData because we need to use await for remark.
    async/await allow you to fetch data asynchronously.
    That means we need to update getStaticProps in pages/posts/[id].js to use await when calling getPostData.
    Finally, update the Post component in pages/posts/[id].js to render contentHtml using dangerouslySetInnerHTML.

How to deploy your Next.js app to Vercel.
The easiest way to deploy Next.js to production is to use the Vercel platform developed by the creators of Next.js.
Vercel is a serverless platform for static and hybrid applications built to integrate with your headless content, commerce, or database. We make it easy for frontend teams to develop, preview, and ship delightful user experiences, where performance is the default. You can start using it for free — no credit card required.

+ Custom Domains: Once deployed on Vercel, you can assign a custom domain to your Next.js app.

+ Environment Variables: You can also set environment variables on Vercel.

+ Automatic HTTPS: HTTPS is enabled by default (including custom domains) and doesn't require extra configuration. We auto-renew SSL certificates
The DPS Workflow: Develop, Preview, and Ship.
How to deploy your Next.js app to your own hosting provider?
   1. Push to GitHub
   2. Create Vercel acoount using your GitHub account
   3. Import the repository
   4. Get the deployment URL
