# Pandas for data science

pandas is like Excel in Python: it uses tables (namely DataFrame) and operates transformations on the data. But it can do a lot more.
The Pandas DataFrame is a structure that contains two-dimensional data and its corresponding labels. DataFrames are widely used in data science, machine learning, scientific computing, and many other data-intensive fields.

DataFrames are similar to SQL tables or the spreadsheets that you work with in Excel or Calc. In many cases, DataFrames are faster, easier to use, and more powerful than tables or spreadsheets because theyâ€™re an integral part of the Python and NumPy ecosystems.

`import pandas as pd`

The most elementary functions of pandas:

  1. Reading data
      data = pd.read_csv('my_file.csv')
  2. Writing data
    data.to_csv('my_new_file.csv', index=None)
  3. Checking the data
     data.shape
     data.describe()
  4. Seeing the data : data.head(3) , data.loc[8]
