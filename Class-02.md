## HTML

**1. Headings and paragraphs**

     * HTML has six "levels" of headings:
<h1> is used for main headings
<h2> is used for subheadings

**2. Bold, italic, emphasis**
  
* Bold : By enclosing words in the tags <b> and </b> we can make characters appear bold and we can use <strong>
* Italic : By enclosing words in the tags <i> and </i> we can make characters appear italic.
* Emphasis : By enclosing words in the tags <em> and </em> we can make characters appear italic

**3. Structural and semantic markup**
     * Structural markup: the elements that you can use to
                          describe both headings and paragraphs
     *Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such
                       as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something
                    you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the
                    meaning of acronyms, and so on
